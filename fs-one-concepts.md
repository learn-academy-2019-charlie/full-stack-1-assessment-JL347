Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.

#### 1. What is Enzyme and what are some of the methods that it provides?

- My answer: Enzyme is the testing suite provided within React. It provides testing of certain components and routes when applicable.
- Google answer: Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components’ output.

#### 2. What is the difference between dynamic and a static routes?

- My answer: Static routes are not going to change whereas dynamic routes would. 
- Google answer: Dynamic = 	superior routing technique which alters the routing information according to the altering network circumstances by examining the arriving routing update messages. Static = does not involve any change in routing table unless the network administrator changes or modify them manually.

#### 3. What is a JSON API?

- My answer: Postman would be an example of one. Basically, it's an API that can print JSON directly.
- Google answer: JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

#### 4. What is a migration and why would you use one?

- My answer: A migration is a command in Rails that would be used to merge your database with the already existing data.
- Google answer: Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner.

#### 5. Explain how to set up a route in React.

- My answer: you would have to install the react-router-dom in your terminal and then import it in your App.js
- Google answer: npm install react-router-dom (in terminal), import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom"; (in App.js)


#### 6. When would you use a generate resource over a generate controller?

- My answer: generate resource will create a controller in addition to routes, models, etc. You'd use this when you want to create everything at one time.
- Google answer: When you use rails g controller and specify the method names, the generator only maps specific routes to the routes file. rails g resource assumes that you want the whole resource functionality and will map resources.

#### 7. Explain the difference between a controller spec and a request spec.

- My answer: controllers specs are used to test single requests. Request specs are used to test the behavior of the full stack.
- Google answer: Controller specs - A controller spec is an RSpec wrapper for a Rails functional test. It allows you to simulate a single http request in each example, and then specify expected outcomes, Request specs - Request specs provide a thin wrapper around Rails' integration tests, and are designed to drive behavior through the full stack, including routing (provided by Rails) and without stubbing (that's up to you).

#### 8. Describe the React component lifecycle. What are some of the lifecycle methods?

- My answer: First a component needs to be initialized, then mounted, then updated, then unmounted. Methods = componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillMount
- Google answer: Basically all the React component’s lifecyle methods can be split in four phases: initialization, mounting, updating and unmounting. Methods = componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillMount

#### 9. At this point in the program, what technologies/languages do you find yourself gravitating to?

- My answer: I tend to find myself gravitating towards frontend technologies. I'm a visual person so the frontend appeals to me and I feel like I work better with those languages given what the end result can bring. I don't mind backend but I just lean towards frontend. I'm also doing research and networking on my own to gain more knowledge of the project management field. That's just been something I'm interested in and pursuing that through the tech industry would be ideal for me.
